# Object Detection using TensorFlow

This project demonstrates **Object Detection** using the TensorFlow framework.  
It loads a pre-trained model and performs detection on sample images such as `cars.jpg` and `images.jpg`.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Object detection using TensorFlow
- Works with images provided in the project
- Easy to extend with your own dataset

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
This project contains the following files and folders:
â”‚â”€â”€ cars.jpg # Sample image of cars used for object detection
â”‚â”€â”€ images.jpg # Another sample image for testing the model
â”‚â”€â”€ proj.py # Main Python script that performs object detection
â”‚â”€â”€ README.md # This file containing project description

**Notes:**
- `proj.py` is the main script where the TensorFlow model is loaded and images are processed.
- `cars.jpg` and `images.jpg` are example inputs, you can add more images for testing.
